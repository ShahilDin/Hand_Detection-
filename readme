- Grab an ROI
- Calculate a running average background value for 60 frames of video
- Once avg value is found then the hand can enter the ROI
- Once the hand enters the ROI , we will use Convex Hull to draw a polygon around the hand
- Use some math to calculate the center of hand against the angle of outer points to infer finer count
- The next step is to use thresholding to grab the hand segment from the ROI
- Next step is to count the fingers being help up
- We can do this by utilizing a Convex Hull
- A convex hull draws a polygon by connecting points around the most external points in a frame
